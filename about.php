            <p>EasyChain, a global platform for investing in loans, is a go-to investment platform where retail investors can invest in a diversified way in income-producing assets to build wealth in the long term.

                By rethinking how money flows across borders from those who want to save and invest to those who want to borrow, we are revolutionizing financial services and contributing to financial inclusion on a global scale.

                Today a market leader with 43.5% share in continental Europe, EasyChain was founded in 2015 by Martins Sulte, Martins Valters and four founding angel investors - Maris Keiss (co-founder of 4finance and Mogo), Aigars Kesenfelds (co-founder of 4finance and Mogo, angel investor in Artsy and Madara Cosmetics), Kristaps Ozols (co-founder of 4finance and Mogo), and Alberts Pole (co-founder of 4finance and Mogo). The company has raised a total of € 4.5 million to date from above-mentioned angel investors.

                In 2020, 6147 crowdfunding investors invested more than €6.55 million in EasyChain, the largest crowdfunding amount ever raised on Crowdcube in continental Europe.</p>
